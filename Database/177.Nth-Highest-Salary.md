# 177. Nth Highest Salary

## 題目

---

- SQL Schema
    
    ```sql
    Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int);
    Truncate table Employee;
    insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('1', '100');
    insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('2', '200');
    insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('3', '300');
    ```
    

Table: `Employee`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

```

Write an SQL query to report the `nth` highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no `nth` highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output:
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
n = 2
Output:
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| null                   |
+------------------------+
```
