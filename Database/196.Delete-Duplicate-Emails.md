# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

## 題目

---

- SQL Schema
    
    ```sql
    Create table If Not Exists Person (Id int, Email varchar(255));
    Truncate table Person;
    insert into Person (id, email) values ('1', 'john@example.com');
    insert into Person (id, email) values ('2', 'bob@example.com');
    insert into Person (id, email) values ('3', 'john@example.com');
    ```
    

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

```

Write an SQL query to **delete** all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```

## 思路

- 將GROUP BY 的結果作為刪除的條件

## Code

- MySQL
    - Runtime: 448 ms, faster than 93.26% of MySQL online submissions for Delete Duplicate Emails.
    - Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Delete Duplicate Emails.
    - 包兩層SubQuery是因為MySQL 不允許在Update, Delete 的Where Condition中使用同張Table 的Select作為條件
    
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Person WHERE id NOT IN ( 
        SELECT sub.id FROM (
            SELECT MIN(id) AS id FROM Person GROUP BY email
        ) AS sub
    )
    ```
    
    - Runtime: 852 ms, faster than 32.91% of MySQL online submissions for Delete Duplicate Emails.
    - Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Delete Duplicate Emails.
    
    ```sql
    DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2 where p1.id > p2.id AND p1.email = p2.email
    ```
