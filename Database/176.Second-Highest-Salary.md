# 176. Second Highest Salary

## 題目

---

- SQL Decima
    
    ```sql
    Create table If Not Exists Employee (id int, salary int)
    Truncate table Employee
    insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('1', '100')
    insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('2', '200')
    insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('3', '300')
    ```
    

Table: `Employee`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

```

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

## 思路

---

- 使用 SubQuery 查詢，MAX 兩次
- DISTINCT 後 OFFSET

## Code

        Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Second Highest Salary.
        
        ```sql
        SELECT MAX(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary FROM `Employee`
        WHERE  Salary < (
            SELECT MAX(Salary) as MaxSalary FROM `Employee`
        ) 
        ORDER BY Salary DESC;
        ```
        
- Method - DISTINC & OFFSET

        ```sql
        SELECT (
            SELECT DISTINCT(salary) FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
        ) as SecondHighestSalary;
        ```

        			(SELECT Salary, RANK () OVER (ORDER BY Salary desc) AS RANK_desc
        			   FROM Employee)
        SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
          FROM CTE
         WHERE RANK_desc = 2
