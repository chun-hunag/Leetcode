# 182. Duplicate Emails

## 題目

---

- SQL Schema
    
    ```sql
    Create table If Not Exists Person (id int, email varchar(255))
    Truncate table Person
    insert into Person (id, email) values ('1', 'a@b.com')
    insert into Person (id, email) values ('2', 'c@d.com')
    insert into Person (id, email) values ('3', 'a@b.com')
    ```
    

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

```

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.
```

## 思路

1. 使用GROUP BY & Sub Query
2. 使用HAVING

## Code

---

- MySQL
    - GROUP BY
        - Runtime: 288 ms, faster than 88.63% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
        - Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
        
        ```sql
        SELECT sub.email AS Email FROM 
            (SELECT email, count(email) as count FROM Person GROUP BY email) AS sub
        WHERE count > 1;
        ```
        
    - HAVING
        - Runtime: 282 ms, faster than 93.03% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
        - Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Duplicate Emails.
        
        ```sql
        SELECT email AS Email FROM Person GROUP BY email Having count(email) > 1;
        ```
