# 197. Rising Temperature

## 題目

---

- SQL Schema
    
    ```jsx
    Create table If Not Exists Weather (id int, recordDate date, temperature int);
    Truncate table Weather;
    insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10');
    insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25');
    insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20');
    insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30');
    ```
    

Table: `Weather`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

```

Write an SQL query to find all dates' `Id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation:
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```
