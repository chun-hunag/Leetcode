- Table Schema
    
    ```sql
    Create table If Not Exists Courses (student varchar(255), class varchar(255));
    Truncate table Courses;
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('A', 'Math');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('B', 'English');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('C', 'Math');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('D', 'Biology');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('E', 'Math');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('F', 'Computer');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('G', 'Math');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('H', 'Math');
    insert into Courses (student, class) values ('I', 'Math');
    ```
    

Table: `Courses`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.

```

Write an SQL query to report all the classes that have **at least five students**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output:
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation:
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
```

## 思路

---

- select with condition from group by result
- use `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`

## Code

---

- MySQL
    - Runtime: 229 ms, faster than 98.69% of MySQL online submissions for Classes More Than 5 Students.
    - Memory Usage: 0B, less than 100.00% of MySQL online submissions for Classes More Than 5 Students.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT class FROM Courses GROUP BY class HAVING count(student) > 4
    ```
