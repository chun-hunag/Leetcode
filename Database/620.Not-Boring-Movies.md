    ```sql
    Table: Cinema
    
    +----------------+----------+
    | Column Name    | Type     |
    +----------------+----------+
    | id             | int      |
    | movie          | varchar  |
    | description    | varchar  |

    id is the primary key for this table.
    Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
    rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
     
    
    Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
    
    Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
    
    The query result format is in the following example.
    
     
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: 
    Cinema table:
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | id | movie      | description | rating |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
    | 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
    | 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
    | 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
    | 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    Output: 
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | id | movie      | description | rating |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    | 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
    | 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
    +----+------------+-------------+--------+
    Explanation: 
    We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.
    ```
    

Table: `Cinema`

```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |

| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
