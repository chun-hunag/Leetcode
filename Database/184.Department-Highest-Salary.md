Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output:

| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
