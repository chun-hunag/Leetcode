- Schema
    
    ```bash
    Drop table if exists Employee;
    Create table If Not Exists Employee (
         Id int, 
         Name varchar(255), 
         Department varchar(255), 
         ManagerId int);
    
    Truncate table Employee;
    insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
         values ('101', 'John', 'A', null);
    insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
         values ('102', 'Dan', 'A', '101');
    insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
         values ('103', 'James', 'A', '101');
    insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
         values ('104', 'Amy', 'A', '101');
    insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
         values ('105', 'Anne', 'A', '101');
    insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId)
         values ('106', 'Ron', 'B', '101');
    ```
    

The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	        |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	        |101       |
|103   |James 	|A 	        |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	        |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	        |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	        |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
```

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

```
+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
```

Note:No one would report to himself.

## Code

- MySQL
    
    Method 1:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Name FROM Employee WHERE id IN (
    	SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING SUM(id)
    );
    ```
    
    Method 2:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT a.Name,COUNT(b.id) FROM Employee a INNER JOIN Employee b ON a.id = b.ManagerId
    GROUP BY a.Name HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) >= 5
    ```
