# 571. Find Median Given Frequency Of Numbers Problem

## 題目

---

- Schema
    
    ```sql
    Drop table If Exists Numbers;
    Create table If Not Exists Numbers (
           Number int, 
           Frequency int
    );
    
    Truncate table Numbers;
    insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('0', '7');
    insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('1', '1');
    insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('2', '3');
    insert into Numbers (Number, Frequency) values ('3', '1');
    ```
    

The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.

```sql
Number | Frequency|
+------+----------+
|    0 |        7 |
+------+----------+
|    1 |        1 |
+------+----------+
|    2 |        3 |
+------+----------+
|    3 |        1 |
```

In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

```sql
|median |
+-------+
|0.0000 |
+-------+
```

Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.

- MySQL
    - Pick Average of numbers where frequency ≥  BIAS(偏差)
    
    ```sql
    SELECT
        AVG(Number) median
    FROM
        Numbers n 
    WHERE 
        n.Frequency >= abs(
                            (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.number)
                            -
                            (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number>=n.number)
    	);
    ```
