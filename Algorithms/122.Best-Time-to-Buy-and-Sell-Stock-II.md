# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## 題目

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## 思路

- 貪婪演算法是將問題拆成子問題，每個子問題求出最佳解，可以讓最終問題接近最佳解
- 把找出最佳操作這個問題拆成每個價格間的最佳獲利是多少，價格每變換一次就計算一次，最後可以得出最大獲利。

## Code

- PHP

    ```php
    class Solution {

        /**
         * @param Integer[] $prices
         * @return Integer
         */
        function maxProfit($prices) {
            $sum = 0;
            $size = count($prices);
            for ($i = 1; $i < $size; $i++) {
                if ($prices[$i] >= $prices[$i-1]) { // 只要當前價格比上一次價格高就計算一次
                    $sum += $prices[$i] - $prices[$i-1];
                }
            }
            return $sum;
        }
    }
    ```
