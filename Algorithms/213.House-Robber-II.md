# 213. House Robber II

## 題目

---

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## 思路

---

- If you rob first house, you can’t rob the last one.
- find max rob result between houses without first and without last
