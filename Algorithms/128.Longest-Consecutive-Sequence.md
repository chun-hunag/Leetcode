# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## 題目

---

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is[1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## 思路

### Sort

1. Sort first  - `O(nlogn)`
2. Find longest  consecutive sequence - `O(n)`
- Question ask time complexity must be `O(n)` , so this way is not work

### Set

1. Literate array and build  a Set
2. Literate array:
    1. If `n-1` is existed in Set, this number is not leading number. So continue next number. length is `1`.
    2. If `n-1` is not existed in Set, this number is leading number.
        1. Check if `n+1` , `n+2` , … is existed in Set or not until, find max length with leading number n.
        2. Compare is longest length or not

        longest := 0
        for _, num := range nums {
            // is num is a leading number or not
            if _, ok := set[num-1]; ok {
                continue
            }
    
            length := 1
            next := num + 1 
            for set[next] {
                next++
                length++
            }
    
            if length > longest {
                longest = length
            }
        }
    
        return longest
    }
    ```
