# 322. Coin Change

## 題目

---

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`
