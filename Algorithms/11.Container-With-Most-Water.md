# 11. Container With Most Water

## 題目

---

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## 思路

---

- Two Pointer + Greedy
    
    The maximum amount  of water is dependent on  lower height pointer of two and length.
    
    If we move one of pointer forward, the lower one is better than height one (Greedy).
    
    - Complexity Analysis
        - Time complexity: O(n). Single pass.
        - Space complexity: O(1). Constant space is used.
