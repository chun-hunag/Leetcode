# 868. Binary Gap

## 題目

---

Given a positive integer `n`, find and return *the **longest distance** between any two **adjacent*** `1`*'s in the binary representation of* `n`*. If there are no two adjacent* `1`*'s, return* `0`*.*

Two `1`'s are **adjacent** if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly no `0`'s). The **distance** between two `1`'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `"1001"` have a distance of 3.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`

## 思路

---

- use `n % 2`  and  `n / 2`  to transfer decimal to binary.
    
    Notice that this way will get reverse binary.
    
    Ex. Decimal `123` binary is `1111011` but we will get  `1101111`
    
- Then calculate `0` number between two `1`  and  `zero count + 1 = gap` between two `1`

                maxGap = max(maxGap, zeroCount+1) // zeroCount +1 = gap between two 1
                zeroCount = 0
            } else if isFirstOneShowed && b == 0 {
                zeroCount++
            } else if b == 1 { // Fist one not show && b == 1
                isFirstOneShowed = true
            } // Fist one not show && b == 0
