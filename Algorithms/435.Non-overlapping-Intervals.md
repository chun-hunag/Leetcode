# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

## 題目

---

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`

## 思路

---

- Sort by intervals start
- Compare overlapping, If is overlapping, remove the longer one

                    // remove longer one (current)
                    current = intervals[i]

                // remove longer one intervals

        }

    }
