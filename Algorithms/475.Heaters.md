# 475. Heaters

## 題目

Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.

Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return *the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.*

**Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 10^9`

## 思路

- Sort & Binary Search
    - Sort Heaters array and perform binary search on the house
    - If the returned index is greater or equal to zero, ,that means the house is located right on heater, we can ignore it
    - If the returned index is smaller than 0, we can have find the left and right heater for this house and get the radius (left will be i -1th and right will be ith position)
    - The min of the radii will compare with the res, and the max of them is our temporary res
    - Time complexity O(nlogn)
    - Space complexity O(1)
- Sort & Two Pointers
    - If we sort both arrays, we just need to find the first heater that is closest to the house
    - Then the result is simply the max of distance between the house-heater and the previous res
    - To find the closest heater, we use while loop until we get the heater that is closer than previous heater
    - Time complexity O(nlogn + mlogn)
    - Space complexity O(1)

## Code

- PHP
    - Sort & Binary Search

        ```php
        class Solution {

            /**
             * @param Integer[] $houses
             * @param Integer[] $heaters
             * @return Integer
             */
            function findRadius($houses, $heaters) {
                sort($heaters);
                $houseSize = count($houses);
                $heaterSize = count($heaters);
                
                $r = 0;
                foreach ($houses as $house) {
                    $i = $this->binarySearch($house, $heaters);
                    if ($i < 0) {
                        $i = -($i + 1);
                        $leftR = $i > 0 ? $house - $heaters[$i - 1] : INF;
                        $rightR = $i < $heaterSize ? $heaters[$i] - $house : INF;
                        $r = max($r, min($leftR, $rightR));
                    }
                }
                return $r;
            }
            
            function binarySearch($key, $array) {
                $l = 0;
                $r = count($array) - 1;
                $mid = intval(($l + $r)/2);

                while ($l <= $r) {
                    $mid = intval(($l + $r)/2);
                    if ($array[$mid] === $key) {
                        return $mid;
                    } elseif ($array[$mid] > $key) {
                        $r = $mid - 1;
                    } else {
                        $l = $mid + 1;
                    }
                    $mid = intval(($l + $r)/2);
                }
                
                return -($l + 1); // 搜尋元素會插入的地方
            }
        }
        ```
