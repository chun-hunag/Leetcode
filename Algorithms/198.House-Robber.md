# 198. House Robber

## 題目

---

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

## 思路

---

- `rob(n) = max(rob(n-2) + money[i], rob(n-1))`
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`

        dp := make([]int, length)
        
        for i := 0; i < length; i++ {
            if i > 1 {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1])
            } else if i > 0 {
                dp[i] = max(nums[i-1], nums[i])
            } else {
                dp[i] = nums[i]
            }
        }
    
        return dp[length-1]
    }
    
    func max(x, y int) int {
        if x > y {
            return x
        }
        
        return y
    }
    ```
