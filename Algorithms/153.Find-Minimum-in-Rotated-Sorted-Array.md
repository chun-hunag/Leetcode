# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## 題目

---

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

## 思路

- Brute Force
    
    Iterate whole array and find min number.
    
    - Time Complexity: `O(N)`
    - Space COmplexity: `O(1)`
- Binary Search
    - Transformed Binary Search
    - Find the reflection point.
    - By comparing to first element to decide search direction:
        - If mid < first element:
            - search left side → `right = mid - 1`
        - If mid > first element:
            - search right side → `left = mid + 1`
    - Binary Search may stop on two point (reflection point’s both side), so we need to judge two condition
        - If `mid > mid + 1` mean `mid+1`  is the min element
        - If `mid < mid - 1` mean `mid` is the min element
