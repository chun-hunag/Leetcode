# 191. Number of 1 Bits

## 題目

---

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `3`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

```

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

**Follow up:**

If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## 思路

---

- if `number ^ 1 = 1` means the first bit is 1.
- We can compare the number’s first bit and then do Bit Shift (`number = number >> 1`) until `number = 0`
